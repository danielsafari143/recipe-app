<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (ruby --version)
- SQLite3 (sqlite3 --version)
- Node.js (node --version)
- Yarn (yarn --version)

### Install

Since Rails started out as a project full of packages and libraries, and has since become the full-stack framework it is, it can be easy to forget that it is also just a package itself.
If these are all good, you can check:

- Rails (rails --version)

If you get a good version, you're ready to go! (Almost).
If you didn't, you may still need to install the Rails gem.

`gem install rails`

It can be good to keep in mind which version you're using as each of these will update on their own schedule and sometimes the code changes just enough to give us bugs. This will be true for all the packages, gems, APIs, or any other dependencies you may bring into your projects as a developer.


### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone https://github.com/danielsafari143/recipe-app.git
```

### Usage

ITo begin with, you need to get your Rails application server running. This is like live preview in the browser for rails applications. Run :


```sh
 $ bin/rails server

```

OR

```sh
$ rails s

```

visit [localhost](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser!

To exit server enter “Control (^ )+ C”
